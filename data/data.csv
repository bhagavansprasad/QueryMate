Intellipaat starts new batches almost every week and they merge the learners as per their convenience and  progress of the batch.


Hence one batch was started last week (7th may) and another batch started today (14th May).
Going forward we will meet new learners again.

All syllabus will be covered for all the batches. That is Intellipaat's responsibility.


So do not merge whatsapp groups or no need to join all whatsapp groups. Keep the groups separated batch wise. It will help the learners coordinate among themselves."
5/14/24,4:06 PM,+91 98537 84862,@919582301910 pls don't post the whatsapp link in every sessions.  It will confuse  learners from other batches.

In the case of fractional seconds precision in the datetime2 datatype, the sql server was throwing an error message during the class. That was because we had used a colon ':' as a separator between seconds and fractional seconds (upto seven digits: 100 ns precision). It turns out the proper delimiter in that place should be a period '.' and I have tried it out. It provided proper output in that case."
5/17/24,8:06 PM,+91 90979 91760,But decimal point is not right format?
5/17/24,8:09 PM,DSDebanjanPhD,"We must use a decimal point (i.e., a period) instead of a colon between seconds and fractional seconds.
The format is the following (in the data type datetime2):
'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.fffffff'"

5/21/24,4:55 PM,🇮🇳DSDrSheshadriSurgeon,Ok. Tnq
5/21/24,4:59 PM,DSDebanjanPhD,"Hi, select statement in the SQL Server prints (displays) the results of the query.
The syntax of the query is the following:

Select column_1, column_2, ...
from table_name

If you wish to display all the fields (records) of the table, then you can use an asterisk (*) instead of the column name(s).
So the syntax for that would look like just what @917093964349 has stated earlier:

Select * table_name

I can see that the name of the table created (table_name) is dep.

So, the command using the select statement will be:

Select * from dep

In addition to that, you can use different clauses or filters to retrieve specific records (rows). For example, let me mention the where clause. The following syntax shows that case:

Select column_1, column_2,...
From table_name
Where condition(s)

There can be other clauses such as order by, group by, etc.

Just one more thing to mention, you can use an aggregate functions such as count, sum, avg, max, min, etc. along with the select statement."

5/22/24,12:39 AM,DSDebanjanPhD,"Hi guys,
I would like to provide some clarification on the command that we used to change a column_name of a particular table. As discussed earlier, the respective syntax is the following:

EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.Table_name.Old_column_name', 'New_column_name', 'COLUMN'

Here, sp_rename is a particular stored procedure that is used to rename a column or a table. In sp_rename sp stands for stored procedure. A stored procedure is a saved block of code prepared beforehand with a specific functionality which can be used time and again when ever required. There are a lot of other stored procedures available, e.g., sp_help. In fact, one can create stored procedures on their own as well.
EXEC is the execute statement that is used to execute a stored procedure just like SELECT statement is used to display the contents of a table. Ine needs to specify the table name along with the old column name within quotes, the new column name, and the word COLUMN (all the three within quotes as shown in the syntax). The word column is necessary to specify so that the SQL Server can understand a particular column needs to be renamed.
In the case of renaming a table, one doesn't need to type the word 'COLUMN'. For that, the following syntax holds:

EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.Old_table_name', 'New_table_name'

The above syntax, I suppose, is self-explanatory.

And regarding dbo, let me just mention that it is a predefined schema in the SQL Server. Another example of predefined schema is sys. One can create their own schema as well, although it might not be always recommended as not to mess with the existing schemas.

I hope this clarifies some doubts that you may have had."

In the class today, someone asked how to calculate the age if one is provided with the date of birth (in other words, how to take the difference between two dates). We can use the DATEDIFF( ) function to accomplish that task. Here is an example:"

5/24/24,3:45 PM,+91 99872 93148,"Thanks a ton buddy,"
5/24/24,3:48 PM,🇮🇳DSDrSheshadriSurgeon,Does any one hv list of syntaxes used till date in note / doc file. It's easy to have those lists to revise. In previous linux classes the trainer had given such list in notepad. It was very easy to recollect or remember.
5/24/24,3:49 PM,+91 94387 76400,Yup may nyone plz share
5/24/24,3:59 PM,+91 96328 88173,"In real time enterprise projects, we don't store ""age"" data in the tables as it has to be updated on daily or monthly basis. We always store ""date of birth"" field and calculate age from it."
5/24/24,3:59 PM,+91 96328 88173,those fields are called base field (date of birth) and derived fields (age as it derived from another field)
5/24/24,4:10 PM,+91 96328 88173,*Quick puzzle if anyone wants to answer/think* - What if the table has millions of records? Age calculation from date of birth would take lot of time. How to solve such problems?
5/24/24,4:15 PM,+91 78298 76662,This can be done by adding a index to the date of birth field. Hope that works.. 😊
5/24/24,4:16 PM,+91 96328 88173,Indexing is useful when we do search on that field as the trainer today morning. We are talking about calculations :)
5/24/24,4:28 PM,+91 78298 76662,"Okai... If you are talking about age, dob and million of records. I would design my tables such a way that my age and dob calculation will be done in one table and may just have a foreign key relationship with the main table which has millions of record. So calculation will be very limited at any point of time.. 🤔"
5/24/24,4:30 PM,+91 96328 88173,"Good thought. However, it would not reduce the number of calculations. If I have 1 million records in main table, same 1 million age calculations would be done on your secondary table also. 
On top of that it would add complexity in joining the main table and secondary table"
5/24/24,4:32 PM,+91 78298 76662,I guess Trigger on insert could be one more option ?
5/24/24,4:33 PM,+91 96328 88173,"that also has to do same age calculation. it would make it slower, not faster"
5/24/24,4:35 PM,+91 78298 76662,Okai let me read the question again...
5/24/24,4:38 PM,+91 96328 88173,I know this is not easy for beginners as the trainer has not taught that topic yet. I am just trying to expand your creative memory to fetch some ideas
5/24/24,4:42 PM,DSDebanjanPhD,"Group the people together who have been born on spans of one year - dividing the timeline into bins of one year width. By doing that, we will be reducing the number of calculations as there are multiple people in one bin (container)."
5/24/24,4:44 PM,+91 96328 88173,good thought. age is normally calculated at day level especially for banking and government related applications
5/24/24,4:49 PM,+91 96328 88173,No one else wants to give a try? Shall I tell you the answer or you want to wait until the trainer tells you next week?
5/24/24,4:50 PM,DSDebanjanPhD,Please wait. I have an idea.
5/24/24,5:01 PM,DSDebanjanPhD,Cast the field with datetime datatype to float and divide by 365.0
5/24/24,5:05 PM,+91 96328 88173,Good idea. How will that make calculation faster? Because datediff function also does the same thing
5/24/24,5:26 PM,DSDebanjanPhD,Can we use a loop for this purpose along with conditional statements (if… else...)?
5/24/24,5:27 PM,+91 96328 88173,Pls explain how that will reduce the computational time
5/24/24,5:28 PM,+91 96328 88173,*Hint:* - the solution is related to the topic discussed today morning
5/24/24,5:30 PM,DSDebanjanPhD,Check?

5/24/24,6:01 PM,+91 96328 88173,Nope
5/24/24,6:01 PM,+91 96328 88173,One more hint : related to indexes
5/24/24,6:08 PM,+91 99208 38811,*Question*: I have a table a table Employee. I want to add identity constraint to empid column of int datatype. How can I achieve it?

5/24/24,6:16 PM,+91 96328 88173,There is no straight way to do this. You have to drop column and add again with identity
5/24/24,6:24 PM,+91 78298 76662,But I already mentioned Indexing at my first throw .. 😟
5/24/24,6:26 PM,🇮🇳DSDrSheshadriSurgeon,Indexing and non indexing can some one explain in simpler words

As discussed with Balgeet sir in class today, I created a trivial GUI registration form using Python in VS Code. How can I feed the entries to a database in the SQL Server? I need to build an API for that. Could anyone please tell me how to get started with this? Balgeet sir has asked me to take the help of ChatGPT for the same."
6/5/24,2:37 PM,DSDebanjanPhD,I guess that API would work similarly for any HTML form as well.
6/5/24,3:31 PM,+91 96678 66478,Has python been started?
6/5/24,3:31 PM,+91 87000 89812,Not yet
6/5/24,3:31 PM,+91 96678 66478,Ok
6/5/24,4:10 PM,+91 99208 38811,it seems you have completed just the GUI part. For saving the details you have to establish a jdbc connection with your database first. For that you might require mssql driver or may be pip install <mssql library>. Then with insert or update method from that driver you can save the changes. A simple google search can help you on that.
6/5/24,4:15 PM,+91 99208 38811,Again GUI is not required if your objective is to save the data using python. You can use Flask Restful service to achieve it.

6/7/24,10:49 AM,DSDebanjanPhD,"During the first half of the class today the discussion was very insightful. Regarding that, I would like to share one particular perspective of mine. One of our classmates who is currently working as a lecturer of Mathematics, was talking about transitioning his career into data science related fields and how he found all the Data Analytics course syllabus so hectic because he is pursuing it alongside teaching Mathematics. I agree with him in this regard. Being trained in Theoretical Physics, I too have some exposure to Modern Mathematics. But I fail to realize how that is relevant to solving problems in the real world. For example, one needs to have a fair amount of working knowledge of Probability and Statistics in order to survive in the Data industry, but one doesn't need to go through the Kolmogorov axioms or the Borel measure, and how a probability measure is defined, and what is a set of events. One doesn't need to have knowledge about the relevant Sigma Algebra axioms. During my Ph.D. coursework, I have realized that Modern Mathematics is all about abstraction and generalizations. We do not consider vectors as directed line segments anymore. Anything can be a vector as long as it follows a certain set of axioms while being defined on a scalar field. Matrices even polynomials are vectors. We generalize the idea of perpendicular vectors with orthogonality in inner product spaces. Even the inner product is an additional structure on a linear vector space. Linearly independent vectors can exist without being orthogonal to each other. We now call them tensors of rank 1. There are even further classifications: contravariant and covariance vectors. And I do not know how the idea of a wedge product which is relevant for entertaining these theoretically, is going to be relevant practically. The concept of distance has also been generalized as a metric, following again a set of axioms. As I mentioned, these concepts are very much useful while dealing with theoretical ideas, but finds relevance in the solutions of real world problems not in a straightforward way, such as the invention of zero (the concept of 'sunyata' or nothingness) was an intellectual exercise back then, which enjoys enormous importance in today's day and age. The idea of open sets and open balls even in higher dimensions has opened the gateway to topology and manifolds, but they remain mostly theoretical concepts except their application in some domains such as Calabi-Yau manifold in string cosmology or the angular momentum algebra of electrons or any spin-1/2 particle, which is nothing but su(2), or the application of Fermat's little theorem in Public key cryptography. Even in SQL, we have used the concept of Cartesian product (an important relation between two sets) while dealing with self join. The ideas and concepts of Pure Mathematics finds their applications in unexpected ways, however it hardly equips us to deal with and solve real-life problems. This has been one of prime reasons for my frustration with Pure Mathematics as it is only concerned with logical beauty of mathematical objects. As I am in the business of Quantum Mechanics, one quote really resonates with me, ""The quantum phenomena does not happen in Hilbet spaces, they happen in a laboratory."" I just took this opportunity to vent my frustration and share my ideas regarding pure mathematics, and I am looking forward to getting to know your response on it. <This message was edited>"
